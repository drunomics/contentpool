## Development

  Just follow the above setup instructions and edit the install profile
  content at web/profiles/contrib/contentpool. You can make sure it's a Git
  checkout by doing:
      
      rm -rf web/profiles/contrib/contentpool
      composer install --prefer-source

## Running tests

 Based upon the detailled installation instructions you can launch tests as
 follows:

    source dotenv/loader.sh
    # Launch tests inside a docker container, so name resolution works thanks to
    # docker host aliases and the PHP environment is controlled by the container.
    docker-compose exec web ./web/profiles/contrib/contentpool/tests/behat/run.sh
