# Helper script to set the following variables:
#
# - GIT_BRANCH - The branch that is currently tested. May be "HEAD" if unknown.
# - GIT_CURRENT_BRANCH - The currently active branch. When develop is merged
#     into the branch, before tests are run the HEAD becomes detached. This
#     variable points to the name of the resulting (possibly temporary) branch.
#
# Usage: eval scripts/util/get-branch.sh

# Determine current branch.

# If a detached HEAD is found, we must give it a branch name. This is necessary
# as composer does not update metadata when dependencies are added in via Git
# commits, thus we need a branch.

  # On travis, fall back to the the travis branch for GIT_BRANCH.
